Tree-Stock Market

Mr X is very curious to know about the frequency of stocks. But unfortunately for him, the stocks are represented as nodes of a tree with prices of the stocks as their value. Mr X hates trees as much as he loves to learn about stocks. So he asks for your help:

 Given a tree with N nodes (each node represents a stock) numbered from 1 to N (rooted at 1). Each stock has a price/value which is denoted by Pi. He is very curious so he asks a lot of questions of the form: U L R . For each of his question he wants to know how many different stock prices/values are present in the subtree of U for which frequency is between L and R(Both inclusive).

Constraints :

1<=N,Q,U<=105

1<=L<=R<=105

1<=Pi<=105

INPUT:

The first line contains 2 space seperated integers N and Q, the number of nodes in the tree and the number of queries

Following N-1 lines contains 2 integers a and b denoting an edge between a and b

Next line contains N space seperated integers denoting the value of each node

Following Q lines contains 3 space seperated integers U,L,R

OUTPUT:

Output Q lines containing the answer of each query.

Hint :

Sack DSU on tree
Sample Input

6 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
5 6
2 1 2 1 1 2
2 2 2
1 2 3
3 1 4

Sample Output

0
2
1


Explanation

0 (1 has frequency 3 and 2 has frequency 1 in the subtree of 2)

2 (1 has freq 3 and 2 has freq 3)

1 (1 has freq 0 and 2 has freq 1)

Zero Xor

A Zero Xor Subset is a non-empty subset having Xor of all the elements in it equal to 0.
Now you are given an array of N numbers.
You have to count the number of different Zero Xor Subsets of this array.

Input:
First line contains a number N
N is the length of the array.
Second line contains the N elements of the array.

Output:
Single number denoting the Count of Zero Xor Subsets of the given array.

Input Constraints:
1<=N<=40
1<=a[i]<=1018

Hint:

Meet in the middle
Sample Input

3
1 2 3

Sample Output

1

Explanation

For [1, 2, 3] ,there is only 1 subset (1, 2, 3) having Xor (1 ^ 2 ^3) = 0.
So, the answer is 1.
